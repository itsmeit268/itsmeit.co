Restores the ability to manually delete iThemes Security logs from the database.

== Description ==

In early 2018, iThemes removed the ability to manually delete the database logs (<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/latest-update-missing-a-button-to-clear-logs/">see this thread</a>). This plugin gives you that control back.

Install, activate, done.
