                An App MOD or modified APK is an altered version of the original, unlocking premium features or changing settings.
                Since MOD APKs may differ from Google Play versions, Play Protect issues warnings.
                For seamless installation of MOD APKs, disable "Play Protect" and ignore warnings.
